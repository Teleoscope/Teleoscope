# Teleoscope

Teleoscope is a system for exploring large document sets by building machine learning workflows. Teleoscope (from [teleology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology) and [telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope)) helps to discover purpose and meaning. The system is designed with qualitative researchers in mind, but can be used by anyone interested in exploring [themes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_analysis) in a large dataset.

## Tutorial

This tutorial uses data from Reddit's [AmITheAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/) advice forum. Follow along step-by-step to learn how the Teleoscope system works and to explore this fascinating slice of the internet.

### Search

A Teleoscope workflow starts with a normal text search. You can use spaces for multiple search terms, quotes to search for exact phrases, and a minus sign to exclude words. The searches are case-insensitive and fuzzy, which means that suffixes such as `-ing` are ignored.

Try copying the following search and clicking on a post to read it.

```markdown copy
"friendly" wedding -mother
```

import Demo from "@/components/Demo/Demo";
export function MakeDemo(props) {
  return <Demo type={props.type} />;
}

<MakeDemo type="Search" />

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout emoji="💡">
  Use up ⬆️ or down ⬇️ to navigate the search results and `Enter` to
  **bookmark**.
</Callout>

### Bookmarks

You can choose documents that you'd like to save to read later by **bookmarking** them. Bookmarks are one of a few ways to **group** documents together. Try bookmarking by clicking on the ⭐ or by pressing `Enter` while a document is selected.

<br />

<MakeDemo type="Bookmarks" />

import GroupWorkIcon from "@mui/icons-material/GroupWork";
export function GroupIcon() {
  return <GroupWorkIcon />;
}

<Callout emoji="💡">
  You can click the <GroupIcon /> to make a **group** from the existing
  bookmarks.
</Callout>

### Groups

You can create **groups** of documents. At first, you can use this just to organize your documents. But, as you use the Teleoscope system more, you'll start to use groups as a primary interaction mechanism.

<br />
<MakeDemo type="Groups" />

import PanToolIcon from "@mui/icons-material/PanTool";

import ControlCameraIcon from "@mui/icons-material/ControlCamera";

import ReadMoreIcon from "@mui/icons-material/ReadMore";

import HeightIcon from "@mui/icons-material/Height";

import RotateRightIcon from "@mui/icons-material/RotateRight";

import MapIcon from "@mui/icons-material/Map";

import AllOutIcon from "@mui/icons-material/AllOut";

### Workspace

All operations take place on the **Workspace**. You can:

- **Pan** by clicking and dragging on the background <PanToolIcon />
- **Move** by clicking and dragging on a workspace item's titlebar <ControlCameraIcon />
- **Resize** by clicking and dragging on the edge of a workspace item ↕️ ↔️
- **Drag and drop** by clicking on a document in the group and dragging it outside of the group <ReadMoreIcon />
- **Zoom in and out** by scrolling the mouse wheel <RotateRightIcon />

There are also reset controls <AllOutIcon /> on the left and a minimap <MapIcon /> on the right if you get lost.

### Teleoscoping

Keyword searches, like above, are great, but they don't get you documents that are **conceptually** similar but have different keywords. With Teleoscope, you search by _example_. The big idea with the Teleoscope that we mix your example documents together to get a much more interesting and relevant results. You connect examples of documents (or groups) to the Teleoscope.

You can click and drag from **output** arrow of a document or group to the bottom **control input** arrow of a Teleoscope. Think of mixing together examples like mixing together paints. The Teleoscope produces a list of documents that are closest in concept (and math) to your example documents.

You can also restrict the Teleoscope to only rank from within a particular source such as a search or group by connecting to the top **source input**.

### Projections

At some point, you might want groups to be automatically created for you. Similar to the Teleoscope function, you can use a **Projection** to automatically create clusters for you.
