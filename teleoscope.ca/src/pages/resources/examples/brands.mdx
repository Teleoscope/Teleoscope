# Exploring Camping and Hiking Brand Reddits

If you are a camper or a hiker, you need to get the lowdown on the best gear. Your life may depend on it. 
[Reddit](https://reddit.com) has a lot of great community discussions about camping and hiking brands.
The [r/CampingandHiking](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampingandHiking/) subreddit can answer a lot of questions.
Specific brands like [Arc'teryx](https://www.reddit.com/r/arcteryx/) have subreddits dedicated to their products.

Let's see how we can use Teleoscope to make sense of the thousands of documents that are in those subreddits. 
Using an old data dump, we have 8234 posts about *Arc'teryx* and 32089 posts in the general *r/CampingandHiking* subreddit. 
That's about *40k* posts to go through. Teleoscope can make that a breeze.

## Getting our data prepared
### Finding usable data
Teleoscope is designed to work with any text data that is between one sentence and a few paragraphs. 
Right now, the model only works with English and Chinese, but we will be updating to include more languages soon.
For now, data needs to be in a `CSV` file to upload to Teleoscope. You can export from an Excel document. 
Many other apps also work directly with `CSV` documents, so see if there's a `CSV` export option from 
whatever data app you're using.

All that Teleoscope needs at a minium is a `text` and `title` field. All the other metatdata is optional. 

### Uploading data to Teleoscope
Once you have your data prepared, you can upload it to Teleoscope by going to the sidebar, 
clicking on `Data` and then `Open CSV Uploader`.
A window will pop up and allow you to browse for your file from your computer.
Once you have selected your file, a preview of your data will open in the same upload popup.

You can then choose which columms from your `CSV` will be used for the `text` and `title`. 
The uploader will select anything called "text" or "title" by default, but you can choose
any of your columns, no matter what they are named.

Other options for metadata will automatically be selected as well, but they are not required.
For example, the dataset below has a column called `metadata.id` and that has been 
automatically chosen as a `Unique ID` column. It's not required, but can be helpful later
when sorting through your data.

## Developing our curiosity
### Browsing Data
Now that we have our data uploaded, we can start to browse through to get an intuition for what might be interesting.

The first post is a post from a moderator. The preview of the post is on the sidebar. We can skim to see that this 
looks something like a recurring post that probably doesn't give us very much information about the brand itself.
We can bookmark it for later, or just ignore it.

![Arcteryx Browse Screenshot](/docs/arcteryx-browse.png)

We can use the up ⬆️ or down ⬇️ arrows on our keyboard to quickly navigate through any list. 
As the document is highlighted, the preview shows up in the sidebar.
If there's anything interesting, we can bookmark with `Enter` or `Return` on the keyboard.
From a quick read, it looks like the first few posts are about needs of police officers,
repairs for burn holes, and care instructions for a jacket. Let's bookmark the post about
police officers, then keep skimming.

After a minute or two of browsing, we can start to get an idea of initial **themes** that might be worth exploring.
Without too much thinking or theorizing, we can see that a lot of posts are about *durability*, *style*, *weather-appropriateness*,
*comfort*, and a variety of *specific use cases*, like our police officer.

This gives us enough to start thinking about potential areas for further exploration. Each of these documents could be the
nucleus of a new idea, theme, or search. Our intuition about this dataset could lead us to believe that the highest-value posts are going to be about 
**brand threats** and **brand opportunities**. Let's start getting more specific.

### Making a theme for broad categories
Let's focus on broad categories first. The theme of *durability* seems to be present in the first few posts. Let's bookmark
everything that has to do with durability. After about two minutes of browsing, we have a small sample of *durability-related* posts in our bookmarks.
Let's make a group from them.

![Arcteryx Durability Group Screenshot](/docs/arcteryx-durability.png)

The point of creating this small sample of documents is that we can now use the <WinIcon type="Rank"/>
[Rank](/resources/reference#-ranking) to find the most similar documents. 
Let's connect the group to a <WinIcon type="Rank"/> [Rank](/resources/reference#-ranking). 
Now all of the documents from the whole dataset are ordered from most to least similar in our 
<WinIcon type="Rank"/> [Rank](/resources/reference#-ranking). We can browse again to see
what themes might be popping up when the broad concept of durability is our focus.

### Using keyword <WinIcon type="Search"/> [Search](/resources/reference#-search) for concrete categories
After skimming for less than a minute again, we can see that "delamination" and "wetting out" are two common phrases that
come up when people talk about durability issues. To make sure that we look at every single instance where someone talks
about "delamination", we can use a keyword <WinIcon type="Search"/> [Search](/resources/reference#-search).

![Arcteryx Delamination Search Screenshot](/docs/arcteryx-delaminate.png)

Now we have a concrete category of delamination-related issues because of a keyword. That's not the only durability
issue, so we should keep on browsing and categorizing to develop other themes. 

### Already getting reportable and analyzable data
This is one possible stopping point for our Teleoscope thematic data exploration. As we can see from the search,
there are 107 possible documents that we may want to drill down on. That could include using Teleoscope to drill down further, 
exporting into a different software, or simply taking notes on all of the issues that customers face with delamination.
If we wanted to report to the quality assurance department that delamination is a problem, we would have concrete data points
to pass along to our engineers and designers now. If we wanted to report to the marketing department that this is a threat to
our brand, we could summarize quotes. A quick skim would let us know that trusting the warranty is a big issue for customers 
on this subreddit, and make recommendations 

As a brief summary, we did the following:
1. Started with an unknown dataset with a vague research question of figuring out what customers have say about this brand.
2. Discovered a few potential themes within a few minutes of exploring the dataset.
3. Drilled down on durability as a broad category to find "delamination" as a key problem that customers talk about.
4. Filtered to a small dataset of 107 documents for further analysis from a dataset of over 40K posts.
5. Found concrete reportable insights in less than 10 minutes.

We went from having no idea about the dataset to something reportable within about 10 minutes total. That's very quick.
Let's see what it looks like to keep going.
